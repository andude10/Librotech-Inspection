# Data Decorator

Data decorators are responsible for composing data from a file for display.

For instance, `class ShortSummaryDecorator` generates a short summary of the file - the beginning of the
record, the end of the record, the number of stamps, etc.

The Presenters folder contains structures that bind decorated data to the view.
