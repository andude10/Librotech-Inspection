# Data parsing 

To parse a .csv file, the CsvFileParser class is used. 
There may be other data formats in the future, they will 
use their own -Parser classes.


There is a comment in the CsvFileParser.cs file that 
describes the parsing algorithm. It's probably (100 percent) 
too convoluted and hard-coded, 
I'll rewrite it in the future when I come up with something better =)
