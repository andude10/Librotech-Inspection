# Parsing all data

Data parsers are used to map data in text format to the Data class (see Models folder).

Parsers are divided into folders depending on the data source (eg csv file).

### Examples

To parse a .csv file, the CsvFileParser class is used.

There is a comment in the CsvFileParser.cs file that describes the parsing algorithm. It's probably (100 percent)
too convoluted and hard-coded, I'll rewrite it in the future when I come up with something better =)
